# ♻️ Smart Waste Segregator 🚮

_Where AI meets cleanliness… and bins become heroes!_

---

## 📖 About the Project
This is **Smart Waste Segregator** — a fun and intelligent AI-powered waste classification system.  
It uses your **webcam**, **deep learning model**, and **bins with personalities** to decide where your trash belongs.  
Because even garbage deserves a good home. 🏠

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Look at the camera** 📷  
   Present the waste item to the webcam.  

2. **AI Thinks** 🤖  
   My trained `keras_model.h5` predicts the type of waste.  

3. **Bin Chooses You** 🗑️  
   The right bin image magically appears — telling you where to throw it!
